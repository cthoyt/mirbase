# miRBase v22.1 Backup

miRBase seeminly deleted its data after version 22.1, this is a re-posting of it.
I've tried (unsuccessfully) to get in touch with the database maintainers at their
official address mirbase@manchester.ac.uk to understand
why most of the data from miRBase seemingly permenantly disappeared from their FTP server.

Luckily, I had a local copy of the v22.1 data locally in my PyOBO cache, so I'm
re-posting it here so I can fix my workflows that rely on the data still existing.

> **Warning**
> I did not make this data! I do not know what the licensing terms are.
> I'm just reposting this for the public good.

Please see the official website at https://mirbase.org and properly cite
the article [miRBase: from microRNA sequences to function](https://bioregistry.io/pubmed:30423142)
if you use it.
